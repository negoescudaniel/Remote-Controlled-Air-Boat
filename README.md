Remote-Controlled Air Boat Project
Overview
This project involves the development of a remote-controlled airboat, utilizing an Arduino Uno to control both a servo for steering and an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) for regulating the speed of the boatâ€™s brushless motor. The Arduino reads input signals from a radio receiver and adjusts the motor speed and steering angle accordingly.

Features
-Servo and ESC Control: The servo is used for steering, and the ESC regulates the speed of the brushless motor to drive the boat.
-Remote Input: The system reads input from a radio control receiver and maps the values to the appropriate range for both steering and throttle control.
-Safety Mechanism: If the control switch is off, the system will stop both the motor and the servo, ensuring safety when the boat is not in operation.

Hardware Components
-Arduino Uno: Central control unit that reads signals from the radio receiver and controls the servo and motor speed.
-Servo Motor: Used to control the steering mechanism of the boat.
-Electronic Speed Controller (ESC): Controls the speed of the brushless motor.
-Brushless Motor: Propels the airboat based on the throttle input.
-Lipo Battery: Powers the ESC and motor.
-Radio Receiver: Provides inputs from the remote control for throttle and steering. I have used the FlySky A6B receiver.
-Radio Transmitter: I have used the FlySky FS-i6x transmitter.

Project Collaboration
This project was created in collaboration with an industrial design student, who designed the 3D model of the boat. 
The physical design and the Arduino-based control system were integrated to create a fully functioning airboat.
